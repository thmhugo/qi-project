*** Objectives

#+begin_quote
- Find the relation between two self-testing conditions:
  - maximal violation of some Bell inequality
  - reproduction of a full-set of measurement correlations
#+end_quote

This equates to finding Bell inequalities which are maximally violated by
measurement correlations which self-test a corresponding quantum state.

More precisely: relate Mayers-Yao self-testing
